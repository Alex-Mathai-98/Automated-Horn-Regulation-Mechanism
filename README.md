# Automates Horn Regulation Mechanism

--> Facbricated a device to be fitted into automobiles for automated horn regulation to prevent unnecessary use of horns

--> The device used a micro-controller that fetched gps location in real time and mapped that across various noise sensitive zones in the city. If the vehicle breached a certian maximum distance barrier, the horn volume was reduced to zero. However the device incorporated emergency mechanisms when required.

--> The project also won first prize at APOGEE 2016 - BITS Pilani's technical fest and we also made it to the finals of Smart India Hackathon 2017
