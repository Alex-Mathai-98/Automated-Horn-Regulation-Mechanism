# SIH17
A project developed for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India at the Grand Finale round of the Smart India Hackathon 2017 (SIH17). 
The project involved the development of an embedded device for vehicles that helps suppress honking in urban areas and the development of a cloud-based system for gathering and analyzing the noise data coming from the device(s).  The project also involves developing and running a simulation of the urban traffic noise to illustrate the noise levels with and without the device.  This repository contains the webserver involved in the project and the simulation used for demonstration.    

Run the webserver using standard django commands.
    Run the Simulation by opening the file simulation.html in Google Chrome.
    Requirements-
